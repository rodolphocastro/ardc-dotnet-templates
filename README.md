## üîß Building and Running

### üî® Build the Project

Since this is a template project all you need to do is run `dotnet new -i .\src\` on the root of this project and all the templates will be installed locally for you to use and test.

When you're done you can run `dotnet new --debug:reinit` to remove those packages from the templates you've installed for `dotnet new`.

### üì¶ Publishing to NuGet

Simply run `dotnet pack --configuration Release -o ./pkgs/` to create a NuGet package (`.nupkg` file) in the `./pkgs/` directory.

Then run `dotnet nuget push "**/*.nupkg" --api-key yourApiKey --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json` to push the packages into [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
